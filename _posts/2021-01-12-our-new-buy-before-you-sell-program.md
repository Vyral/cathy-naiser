<center><em>There&rsquo;s a way for you to buy a new home before you sell.</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

For years, we’ve helped people in Bexar and the surrounding counties sell their homes and buy other homes. That’s a challenge for many because they need to sell their home first, but can’t seem to buy a home first. Now, however, we have our Buy Before You Sell plan that our sellers love.

In the past, **we used to help people sell and buy using contingent offers, meaning they would go find a house before their own sold** and place an offer on it that was contingent on the sale of their current home. That way, if the buyer’s own home didn’t sell, they would be able to walk out on their offer to the seller.

That used to work, but for a while now, our market has been very hot, and sellers have had plenty of buyers to choose from. Buyers with contingent offers haven’t been getting theirs accepted very much at all.

So what happens then? Well, sellers have to get their homes ready, put them on the market, have showings, get it under contract, and before it closes, move somewhere temporarily. Then they go find another home and use the funds from their current sale to buy it.

**Now we have the option to help sellers buy a home before they sell their current one.** First, our clients are qualified through our partner company, which will likely end up financing their home. Once they’re qualified, we help them find a home and write a competitive offer on it.&nbsp;

Our partner company buys the house with a cash offer (which often wins in multiple-offer situations), and our clients are able to move into that house while they get their own house fixed up, listed to the market, and sold. **When their house closes, they can immediately buy the home back from our partner company.** There is a 1.9% fee if they don’t finance with our partner company and 1.4% if they do. Clients will also have to pay rent for the time they lived in the house before they bought it—but they’d have to pay rent if they moved somewhere temporarily, too.

The convenience of this program is that you wouldn’t have to move twice and you have the opportunity to move out of your current home while you prep it for the market. That’s huge for a lot of people.

Whether you’re looking to sell the traditional way or you’re interested in our Buy Before You Sell plan, don’t hesitate to reach out to us for your real estate needs. We have many programs that can work to your benefit.
