With today's ever challenging housing market in full swing, buyers and sellers are becoming more resourceful to make their real estate dreams a reality. This year I am noticing many clients utilizing **their tax refunds** to them accomplish their real estate goals.

Some homebuyers are using the extra cash to increase their down payment and make an aggressive offer on a home they love. Meanwhile, sellers are using their refunds to pay for appraisal fees, closing costs, or upgrades on their homes before selling. I’ve even seen investors put their refunds in a money market fund for a down payment on an investment property.&nbsp;

**Interest rates are starting to increase and they will continue to go up. This means it is a great time to buy a home now and lock in a historically low rate while you still can.**

If you have questions about buying, selling, investing, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon\!
