I’m seeing people use their tax refunds to buy and sell real estate in many different ways.&nbsp;

Some homebuyers are using the extra cash to increase their down payment and make an aggressive offer on a home they love. Meanwhile, sellers are using their refunds to pay for appraisal fees, closing costs, or upgrades their homes before selling. I’ve even seen investors put their refunds in a money market fund for a down payment on an investment property.&nbsp;

**Interest rates are starting to increase, and they will continue to go up, so it’s a great time to buy a home and lock &nbsp;in a rate.**

If you have questions about buying, selling, investing, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
