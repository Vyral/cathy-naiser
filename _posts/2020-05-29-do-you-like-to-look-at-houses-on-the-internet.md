If you like to spend time looking online at the latest real estate statistics and browsing homes for sale, then you’re going to love this new app.

If you haven’t heard yet, the new Keller Williams app just launched and it’s fantastic.&nbsp;

**To download it, all you have to do is text “KW15TB9I” to 87778.**

You’ll get a link sent to you and you can download the app right on your phone by clicking the aforementioned link.

Like most real estate apps, this app allows you to narrow down your home search. **In addition to searching by area and price range, you can search by school, school district, or neighborhood.** No other app has something like this.&nbsp;

Down at the bottom of the app, if you click the icon that says “more,” you can do several things. **You can add a co-buyer, apply for a mortgage with Keller Mortgage, or get instant homeowners insurance quotes from multiple companies with Keller Covered.** We don’t sell insurance, but our app allows you to compare insurance companies and even get an extra discount.

With this app, you can also call, email, or text me with any questions right from the app. This is one of the most cutting-edge real estate tools out there.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
