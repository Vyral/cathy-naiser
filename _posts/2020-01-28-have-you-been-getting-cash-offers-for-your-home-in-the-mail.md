I’m devoting today’s message to making sense of those home offers you’ve likely been receiving in the mail. There are different types of offers sent out by different types of interested parties. For example, there are wholesalers, investor flippers, and iBuyers. Our focus will be on iBuyers, or institutional buyers, which have become so prevalent in today’s market.&nbsp;
