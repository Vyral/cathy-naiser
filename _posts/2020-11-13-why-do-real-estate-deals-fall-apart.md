Ever wonder why contracts fall through and houses go back on the market? Today we’re going to through some of the most common reasons why this situation occurs and how we can help you avoid this.

**If a buyer is moving too fast, for example, and they throw in an offer just to win the house, they can sometimes have buyer’s remorse and terminate the contract.** That’s a difficult situation for everyone involved. With our listings, we have several things in place to make sure the buyer takes a little bit of time to think about their offer before it’s presented. We also research the buyer before we go under contract with them.

Because we’ve seen so many houses throughout the years, we are able to really help our buyers evaluate properties before ever making an offer. We explain the market, the pros and cons of the house, and then advise on how to go forward. Not all agents do that.

**Another reason deals fall apart stems from appraisal issues.** In this hot seller’s market, more and more homes are selling over list price. The problem with this is that they don’t always appraise, which can create a problematic situation. When we meet with buyers and sellers, we really emphasize and discuss the expectations around the appraisal so that if it does come in low, our clients already know the best course to follow. Our experience really helps our clients.

Buying and selling a home is one of the largest financial transactions of your life and it can become emotional and stressful. We hold in-depth consultations before even beginning the process so we can explain the ups and downs of the journey so they totally understand what’s happening and are prepared. **With as many clients as we’ve helped throughout the years, we can answer any questions a client may have.**

We also work with the agent on the other side of the transition to make sure all expectations are clear, timelines are clear, and everyone is on the same page. We “bulletproof” the transaction as much as we can prior to even starting it.

**Even with all the preparation in the world, some contracts will still fall through.** When they do, we are ready and equipped with a positive plan to move forward so our clients still win the day in their home buying or selling journey.

If you have any questions for me about this topic or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
