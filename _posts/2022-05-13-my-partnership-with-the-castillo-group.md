I was recently at an event supporting local educators, and people kept coming up to me asking questions like, “What’s with all this Castillo Group stuff?” Some know what's happening from our email back in February, but if you missed it, **The Naiser Real Estate Group has merged with The Castillo Group.** We decided it was in the best interest of our clients and business to pool our resources and work together. We’re able to serve you at an even higher level as a result.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
