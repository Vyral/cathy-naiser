Many of you have been asking me the same question since I joined up with The Castillo Group: Who is Ryan? Today I want to introduce you to Ryan Cover, the Director of Sales for The Castillo Group. He’s in charge of the follow-up department as well, so he’s the one who has been reaching out to many of you and leading you to ask me who he is.

**Ryan joined me on this video because he wanted to let you know that if you have any questions about your real estate needs, you can reach out directly to him.** He’s here to help make the real estate process as smooth as possible by continuing to provide the five-star customer service we’re known for. I joined this team in part because of the five-star customer experience they have created. It was a great value match for me because of how I like to treat my clients.
