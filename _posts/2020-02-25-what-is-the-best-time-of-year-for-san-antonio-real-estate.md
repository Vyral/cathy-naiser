People often ask me, “What is the best time of year to buy or sell a home in San Antonio?”&nbsp;

Since our market is very steady,&nbsp;**I find that the ratio between houses on the market and houses being purchased to be fairly consistent throughout the year.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

In the fall and winter, there are fewer houses on the market and fewer buyers buying. This means buyers and sellers have less competition. In the spring and summer, there are more houses on the market and more competition.&nbsp;

**No matter what time of year that you decide to list or buy, you will do the best when you have a great strategy.**&nbsp;Right now, interest rates are still low and I have ways to save you money on closing costs– if you’re a buyer. For sellers, I’m seeing buyers become a little more picky. Updated homes are doing very well, while those that aren’t should have a different selling strategy.

Meeting with a great real estate agent, like me, can let you know exactly what to do to prepare your home for the market.&nbsp;**Remember that I can also provide an instant cash offer. This can help if you want to sell without showings and you want a flexible closing date.**

Ultimately, the best time to buy or sell is when the time is right for you. If anytime in 2020 is the right time for you, feel free to reach out to me via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
