Whether you’re buying or selling a home, here’s how we can help.

We at the Naiser Real Estate Group have so many ways to help people, whether they’re buying or selling a home, or not. Today I’ll outline just a few of the ways we can assist you:

* If you’re not selling your home, you may want to think about refinancing it. If you haven’t already, you could refinance your home with a **Keller Mortgage Zero Plus loan**, which would save you thousands of dollars on fees and interest. Buyers can also save thousands using this loan; call us first, though, because there may be other programs that can help you as well.
* With home prices and appreciation on the rise, your home may actually be underinsured. To get custom quotes from multiple insurance companies, visit [**www.KellerCovered.com**](http://www.kellercovered.com)**.** If you mention me as your agent, you can get a discount.&nbsp;
* You can also watch prices in your neighborhood and the surrounding areas by using our **Monthly Neighborhood Snapshot.** If you’re not already receiving those, reach out to us and we’d happily add you to our contact list.
* To make your next home search easier, [**download my app on your phone**](https://kw.com/download/KW15TB9I?_branch_match_id=901560592198751190)**,** which lets you search by neighborhood, school, and ZIP code.
* If you’re looking to buy a home before you sell your current one, our **Buy Before You Sell Plan** is exactly what you need. Reach out to us for more details\!
* You could get instant cash offers for your home without showings or commission when you work with me through **Keller Offers**. Keller Offers is an iBuyer program like OpenDoor and Zillow, except we won’t charge you a commission.
* Use our **upsize and downsize programs** to sell your home and buy a new or pre-owned home, or even build one. These programs often beat the move-up programs that builders provide
* Call us to learn about our **Win the House Program**. It’s very competitive for buyers in the market, but luckily this special program will help you win the house you desire.&nbsp;

These are just a few of the ways we serve people and help them move forward in their lives. No matter if you’re thinking about buying or selling a home or something else, consider us as your real estate resource. Don’t hesitate to reach out\! We’d love to help you.
