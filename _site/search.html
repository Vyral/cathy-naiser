Reflect on whatâs important to you and how you can nurture that in your life. Reflect on what youâre grateful for and what youâve learned.I wish you time to relax. These last couple of years have been hard, so relax and heal from the losses, drama, and pain.I wish you time for fun. We havenât had nearly enough of it, so really embrace having fun during the holidays.âReflect on whatâs important to you and how you can nurture that in your life.âI wish you time to dream. Dream about what can be, where you want to go, or what you want your life to look like someday. Walt Disney created his vision of Disneyland long before it existed. What is your legacy?I wish you time to plan. How are you going to march towards that legacy every day?I wish you time to remember and be in the moment. The best âsomedayâ is the day we have right now.We all come from different spiritual traditions and backgrounds, but Iâm sure we all believe in love and the power of good in the world. In my tradition, we say merry Christmas. Whatever your holiday is, I wish you the best holiday and a very happy new year.If you have any questions, feel free to call or email me.

        "title": "Tracking Our Changing Interest Rates",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Hereâs what our changing interest rates mean for buyers and sellers.Today Iâm joined by guest speaker Holden Hamilton, one of my favorite loan officers from Gold Financial, who is here to tell us what has happened over the last couple of years in terms of interest rates.Back in May of 2020, though everyone started to feel the repercussions of COVID in terms of jobs, those of us in real estate were very blessed to be in the housing industry during that rough time. The Federal Reserve started purchasing mortgage-backed securities and bonds at nearly $120 million a month. Market watchers predicted the tapering of bonds per FED announcements late September 2021. With this news the market reacted with an increase in interest rates over the past few weeks. The official announcement came early November and will begin to actually taper December of 2021. That had the effect of hiking up interest rates, along with inflation, unemployment, and other miscellaneous factors.For reference, here are some key statistics to note: One year ago your interest rate on a $300,000 home would have been 2.75%, which would put you at $1,163 a month in principle and interest. A month ago, the rate was 3.125%, which would have put you at a $1,220 monthly payment. Today the rate is 3.375%, which is a $1,259 monthly payment. Thatâs a $96 difference!As economists and leaders in our industry, we look at where itâs most beneficial to invest that money, be it in the real estate market or the stock market. Suppose you took that $96 you would have saved if you bought a year ago and put it in the stock market at an average rate of about 10% per yearâif you would have done that over the life of your 30-year loan, it would amount to $218,000 from just a $96 monthly investment.Â âIf youâre buying or selling a home this year, you could be impacted by rising interest rates.âYou also have to look at appreciation. Homes have appreciated at about a rate of 7.83% over the last three years. If you bought a $300,000 home two or three years ago, your home would be worth around $376,000 today. Thatâs a huge difference!So what does this all mean? It means that now is not the time to wait; you donât want to get to a point where homes are so expensive that you canât buy what you want. You also donât want to buy it at an increased interest rate; ideally, youâd retain that money and invest it elsewhere, letting it do the work for you.If you think that itâs best to wait until the spring or summer of next year to buy, understand that interest rates may be even higher then. Though it may be a little bit of a challenge to sell during the holidays, many buyers still purchase homes during this time because itâs very nostalgic to buy a home for Christmas.Ultimately, if youâre buying or selling a home this year, you could be impacted by rising interest rates. Give us a call or send an email today. Letâs talk through the benefits of acting now as opposed to waiting.Â ",

        "content": "Whether you&rsquo;re buying or selling a home, here&rsquo;s how we can help.&nbsp;We at the Naiser Real Estate Group have so many ways to help people, whether theyâre buying, selling, or doing neither. Today Iâll outline just a few of the ways we can assist you:  If youâre not selling your home, you may want to think about refinancing it. If you havenât already, you could refinance your home with a Keller Mortgage Zero Plus loan, which would save you thousands of dollars on fees and interest. Buyers can also save thousands using this loan; call us first, though, because there may be other programs that can help you as well.  With home prices and appreciation on the rise, your home may actually be underinsured. To get custom quotes from multiple insurance companies, visit www.KellerCovered.com. If you mention me as your agent, you can get a discount.Â   You can also watch prices in your neighborhood and the surrounding areas by using our Monthly Neighborhood Snapshot. If youâre not already receiving those, reach out to us and weâd happily add you to our contact list.  To make your next home search easier, download my app on your phone, which lets you search by neighborhood, school, and ZIP code.  If youâre looking to buy a home before you sell your current one, our Buy Before You Sell Plan is exactly what you need. Reach out to us for more details!  You could get instant cash offers for your home without showings or commission when you work with me through Keller Offers. Keller Offers is an iBuyer program like OpenDoor and Zillow, except we wonât charge you a commission.  Use our upsize and downsize programs to sell your home, buy a new or pre-owned home, or even build one. These programs often beat the move-up programs that builders provide.  Call us to learn about our Win the House Program.

        "category": "",
        "content": "There&rsquo;s a way for you to buy a new home before you sell.&nbsp;For years, weâve helped people in Bexar and the surrounding counties sell their homes and buy other homes. Thatâs a challenge for many because they need to sell their home first, but canât seem to buy a home first. Now, however, we have our Buy Before You Sell plan that our sellers love.In the past, we used to help people sell and buy using contingent offers, meaning they would go find a house before their own sold and place an offer on it that was contingent on the sale of their current home.Â That used to work, but for a while now, our market has been very hot, and sellers have had plenty of buyers to choose from. Buyers with contingent offers havenât been getting theirs accepted very much at all.So what happens then? Well, sellers have to get their homes ready, put them on the market, have showings, get it under contract, and before it closes, move somewhere temporarily. Then they go find another home and use the funds from their current sale to buy it.Now we have the option to help sellers buy a home before they sell their current one. First, our clients are qualified through our partner company, which will likely end up financing their home. Once theyâre qualified, we help them find a home and write a competitive offer on it.Â Our partner company buys the house with a cash offer (which often wins in multiple-offer situations), and our clients are able to move into that house while they get their own house fixed up, listed to the market, and sold. When their house closes, they can immediately buy the home back from our partner company. There is a 1.9% fee if they donât finance with our partner company and 1.4% if they do. Clients will also have to pay rent for the time they lived in the house before they bought itâbut theyâd have to pay rent if they moved somewhere temporarily, too.The convenience of this program is that you wouldnât have to move twice and you have the opportunity to move out of your current home while you prep it for the market. Thatâs huge for a lot of people.âThe convenience of this program is that you wouldnât have to move twice.âWhether youâre looking to sell the traditional way or youâre interested in our Buy Before You Sell plan, donât hesitate to reach out to us for your real estate needs.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Ever wonder why contracts fall through and houses go back on the market? Today weâre going to through some of the most common reasons why this situation occurs and how we can help you avoid this.If a buyer is moving too fast, for example, and they throw in an offer just to win the house, they can sometimes have buyerâs remorse and terminate the contract. Thatâs a difficult situation for everyone involved. With our listings, we have several things in place to make sure the buyer takes a little bit of time to think about their offer before itâs presented. We also research the buyer before we go under contract with them.Because weâve seen so many houses throughout the years, we are able to really help our buyers evaluate properties before ever making an offer. We explain the market, the pros and cons of the house, and then advise on how to go forward. Not all agents do that.âOur experience really helps our clients.âAnother reason deals fall apart stems from appraisal issues. In this hot sellerâs market, more and more homes are selling over list price. The problem with this is that they donât always appraise, which can create a problematic situation. When we meet with buyers and sellers, we really emphasize and discuss the expectations around the appraisal so that if it does come in low, our clients already know the best course to follow. Our experience really helps our clients.Buying and selling a home is one of the largest financial transactions of your life and it can become emotional and stressful. We hold in-depth consultations before even beginning the process so we can explain the ups and downs of the journey so they totally understand whatâs happening and are prepared. With as many clients as weâve helped throughout the years, we can answer any questions a client may have.We also work with the agent on the other side of the transition to make sure all expectations are clear, timelines are clear, and everyone is on the same page. We âbulletproofâ the transaction as much as we can prior to even starting it.Even with all the preparation in the world, some contracts will still fall through. When they do, we are ready and equipped with a positive plan to move forward so our clients still win the day in their home buying or selling journey.If you have any questions for me about this topic or anything else related to real estate, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "title": "How Can Buyers Win a Bidding War?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Iâve been hearing of buyers and sellers who donât even want to enter the market because theyâre afraid of the competition that comes with the frequent bidding wars we see in our market. Today Iâm here to say that you donât have to be afraid of bidding wars, and there are ways you can win them. Occasionally one of our buyers will lose a bidding war to a cash buyer, but most of the time, they come out on top. Here are my tips to help you find success in our competitive market:1. Work with an experienced agent who can offer a proven strategy.Â 2. Make a good offer. In this market, you should offer full price or more; in most bidding wars that Iâm seeing, homes are selling between $10,000 and $20,000 over list price.3. Shorten your timelines. Having shorter timelines in your contract can make a seller very happy and more likely to accept your offer over others who havenât shortened theirs.4. Ask the seller for as few closing costs as possible. Sometimes buyers ask the sellers to pay some of their closing costs, but sellers have their own, as well. Buyers who ask too much in this regard rarely win bidding wars. If you need closing costs assistance, then apply for a down payment assistance program, or get gift funds from family.âIf you can afford to pay your closing costs, then I encourage you to go in guns blazing with an offer that no one can beat.â5. Write a personal letter to go with your offer. Include a picture of you and your family (as well as any pets) and let the seller know why their house is perfect for your family. Sellers love these kinds of letters, and sometimes they can even make the difference between getting accepted or rejected.6. Offer to pay some of the sellerâs fees. If you make an offer above full price but the house doesnât appraise, the seller has to come down some. The seller will be happier with your offer in that scenario because youâll be paying some of their fees, allowing them to net more.7. Send the sellers a comparative net sheet of all their offers. Some sellers donât even know what the offer is going to net them because their agent doesnât know how to do net sheets (or doesnât do them well). Have your agent send over a net sheet that shows them how much your offer will net them now as well as what it would net if their home didnât appraise.These tips will help you give your offer a competitive edge in this market. If youâre trying to avoid a bidding war, look at houses that have been on the market for 10 to 14 days; they could still end up with multiple offers, but itâs not likely to get out of hand. If you can afford to pay your closing costs, then I encourage you to go in guns blazing with an offer that no one can beat.If we can help you come up with a strategy based on your situation, reach out to us. We love working with buyers and sellers, and weâd be happy to help.",

        "title": "Q: Which 5 Home Improvements Offer a Great Return?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Recently, Iâve helped a number of people sell their homes, and one lady in particular needed some painting and landscaping work done on her property. She consulted with us and followed our instructions for some simple updates to make around her home. After a staging consultation, we listed the home and received multiple offers on it after just four days, which drove the price up as high as it could go. If you want to follow in this sellerâs footsteps and sell quickly for above asking price, keep these specific home improvements in mind:Â 1. Neutralize the color palette. Light gray is a very popular color these days, but beige or even âgreigeâ are also solid choices that buyers seem to love. Just make sure that the gray you pick doesnât appear as a light blue in your homeâs lighting.Â 2. Update your curb appeal. Your front door is very important as far as first impressions go, so restain or repaint it if it looks dated. If itâs noticeably worn or has busted hardware, replacing it will definitely be worth your money. Also, power washing the driveway and sidewalks makes everything seem fresher, as does adding new plants to your flower bed. Mulch is the amazing forgiver of all home gardening sins, so be sure to add a fresh layer in there, too. Donât forget to keep your shrubs and trees trimmed so that there are no branches hanging down precariously over the roof.Â âMulch is the amazing forgiver of all home gardening sins, so be sure to add a fresh layer in your flower bed.â3. Update your flooring. Waterproof vinyl-plank âwoodâ flooring is quite popular right now because itâs much easier to install (and uninstall) than ceramic tile and it looks sleek. If you have older carpets, itâs time to replace them. If youâre worrying about buyers not liking the new carpet you choose, donâtâeven if your buyer ends up replacing it later, your home will always show 10x better with brand-new carpets, and thatâs what counts. Youâll also want to clean the grout on your tile floors (if you need help with this, I have an amazing vendor who specializes in making grout look fresh).Â 4. Update your kitchen. This is probably the most important room in your whole house, so update it as much as you can. That could mean adding some new fixtures or staining or repainting the cabinets a nice clean white or grayish color. Of course, granite or quartz countertops always help as well.Â 5. Let in as much natural light as you can. Open things up and let the sunshine brighten every space in your home. Clean the blinds, clean the windows, and remove solar screens if you have them. Before listing, it might behoove you to invest in some âdaylightâ light bulbsâthey really provide a certain glow that buyers respond well to.Â Hopefully you found this list to be helpful. Donât hesitate to reach out by phone or email if you want some specialized information for your particular selling needs; weâd be more than happy to check out your home and offer some tips and tricks.

        "title": "Why Our Market Is Not Like the One We Saw Back in 2008",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Considering everything thatâs happening with the COVID-19 pandemic, now is an uncertain time in the world, but the real estate market is moving ahead. To be clear, this market is not like the one we saw back in 2008 that led to the Great Recession, and there are several reasons why.Â 1. Mortgage standards arenât the same. In 2008, mortgage standards were very loose. Anyone could get a loan. You could have bad credit, you did not have to prove your income and appraisals were super high. After the market crashed, the lesson was learned, and mortgage standards were tightened. Now you need good credit and solid, provable income, and appraisals arenât coming in high anymore.Â 2. Prices are in control. Housing prices have been rising steadily in San Antonio and across the nation but not at the rate that they were in 2008. Back then, prices were skyrocketing and investors from California were swooping in and buying entire neighborhoods sight unseen because they could get them cheaply (even though they were so expensive for regular consumers).3. 2008 had too much inventory. In other words, there were too many houses on the market, but thatâs not the case today. Weâve been pretty consistent inventory-wise. Each month we may have about 7,500 houses for sale, but only about 2,500 to 3,500 are selling, and those numbers stay the same even as we enter April 2020.Â âThe point is, people are still buying and selling.â4. People have more equity in their homes now. In 2008, many people were buying homes with crazy loans and found themselves upside down on their mortgages. When those people couldnât afford to sell, they went into foreclosure, which exacerbated the problem. People are being wiser with their home purchases, though, and thatâs resulted in a general increase in equity.Â 5. Sales continue. Even with the stay-at-home order in place, the week prior to the recording of this video saw the following stats:  1,501 new listings  969 houses went under contract  758 houses soldEven stranger, in the 24 hours prior to this video, there were 364 new listings and 220 homes that went under contract.Â The point is, people are still buying and selling. Weâve attended meetings, coordinated home equity assessments, and held home buying appointments all on virtual platforms. If you want to buy now, we can grant you a virtual showing and spotlight every inch of a property. We also offer 24-hour open houses featuring detailed walk-throughs. Thereâs no sense in waiting a few weeksâthe market is taking off now.Â If you have questions about this or any other real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâm here to help, and I hope you and your family are staying safe during this time.Â ",

This means buyers and sellers have less competition.

			<p>Cathy Naiser, Realtor Powered X The Castillo Group is a small group of very dedicated real estate agents and operations personnel led by Cathy Naiser. We work with Sellers, Buyers, and Investors and believe that excellent customer service comes from using the best technology and providing the best personal attention.Â </p>

<p>Cathy Naiser has been professionally serving the community in Education and then in Real Estate for over 25 years. After graduation from college, Cathy entered the Convent and became a Catholic Nun. Simultaneously, she began her professional career as a middle school band director. While she remained in the convent for only 4 years, she taught school for 20 years. Most of those years were spent teaching in San Antonio, Texas. After 20 years in the teaching profession, Cathy retired early. She studied real estate investing and began âflipping housesâ. She became quite proficient in the real estate investing arena while flipping 23 houses in a 12-month period. In addition to wholesaling houses, she rehabbed houses, purchased rental properties, sold houses âowner financedâ and sold notes on houses.Â </p>

<p>During that time, she became a licensed real estate agent. She used her license to help her find and evaluate potential investment properties. Later, she joined Keller Williams and worked to become one of the Top Agents in the company. Her knowledge of real estate throughout the city was vast, and she attracted many buyers, sellers and investors. For 10 years, she has served on the Agent Leadership Council and the Faculty at Keller Williams Realty City View. Because of her high production and service to the community Cathy was named one of the cityâs âPlatinum Top 50â agent winners for 9 years in a row.Â </p>

<p>She enjoys offering money saving programs to her clients and helping them reach their goals. Her mission (in Real Estate and Life) is to learn, grow, and be the best she can be while positively influencing others and helping them move towards their goals.</p>
